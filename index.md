I am a Research Associate at The Alan Turing Institute, London, working on robust reasoning in Large Language Models using probabilistic Answer Set Programming (P-ASP) scaffolds.

My research lies at the intersection of neuro-symbolic AI, knowledge graphs, and uncertainty-aware reasoning, with a focus on designing AI systems that are interpretable, logically grounded, and robust beyond pattern matching.
